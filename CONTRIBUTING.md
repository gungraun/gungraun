## Patches / Pull Requests

All patches have to be sent on GitHub as [pull
requests](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun/pulls). Before starting
a pull request, it is best to open an issue first so no efforts are wasted.

If you are looking for a place to start contributing to Gungraun, take a
look at the [help
wanted](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun/labels/help%20wanted) or
[good first
issue](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun/labels/good%20first%20issue)
issues.

The minimum supported version (MSRV) of Gungraun is Rust `1.74.1` and all
patches are expected to work with the minimum supported version.

All notable changes need to be added to the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun/blob/4f29964c153a2dd20283fb1502db3de630148629/CHANGELOG.md).

## How to get started

Clone this repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun.git
cd gungraun
```

Working on this project is a piece of cake with
[just](https://github.com/casey/just) and the `just` shell completions
installed. Using `just` also ensures that you use the same commands, arguments,
options as they are used in the ci.

Before running any install commands with `just`, it is recommended to first
inspect it with `--dry-run` and see if you're fine with the changes. Install the
basics needed to start working on this project with:

```shell
just install-workspace
```

This command will install git hooks, the necessary components for the `stable`,
`nightly` toolchain and the current MSRV toolchain, run some checks for tools
which need to be installed, ...

To get an overview over all possible `just` rules run `just -l` or directly
inspect the `Justfile` in the root of this project.

You should also set up your editor to use nightly rustfmt and clippy from the
rust `stable` toolchain for example with `rust-analyzer` server overrides. An
alternative to server overrides is to use tasks which are executed on save and
use `just fmt` to format the project with nightly `rustfmt` and `just lint` to
lint with stable clippy.

Some examples for `rust-analyzer` server overrides:

### Configure VSCode server overrides

Go to settings, choose workspace or folder settings and edit the `settings.json`
file:

```json
{
    "settings": {
        "rust-analyzer.check.overrideCommand": [
          "cargo",
          "+stable",
          "clippy",
          "--message-format=json",
          "--all-features",
          "--all-targets",
          "--workspace"
        ],
        "rust-analyzer.rustfmt.overrideCommand": [
          "rustfmt",
          "+nightly",
          "--edition",
          "2021",
          "--emit",
          "stdout"
        ],
    }
}
```

### Configure Neovim server overrides

In neovim you need to set the override commands in the `rust-analyzer` server
table. The specifics depend on the plugin which is used to install/configure
`rust-analyzer`, i.e. `mason` or `rustaceanvim`, but the principle stays the
same:

```lua
["rust-analyzer"] = {
    check = {
        overrideCommand = {
            "cargo",
            "+stable",
            "clippy",
            "--message-format=json",
            "--all-features",
            "--all-targets",
            "--workspace",
        },
    },
    rustfmt = {
        overrideCommand = {
            "rustfmt",
            "+nightly",
            "--edition",
            "2021",
            "--emit",
            "stdout",
        },
    },
}
```

## Working on the guide

The main documentation of Gungraun is in the [guide][Guide]. The source
code lives in the `docs/src` subdirectory of this repo.

To start working on the guide, ensure you have everything necessary installed
with `just book-install`. After everything's installed, you need two terminal
windows. In the first run `just book-watch` and in the second run `just
book-serve-github`. The second command makes the rendered guide available at
`http://localhost:4000/gungraun` (this'll redirect you to the
`index.html`). You can now start making changes to the source code and the
changes are reflected after a second or two.

Please run `just book-tests` from time to time if you make changes to rust
codeblocks and especially before pushing to the pr.

Have a look at the existing code blocks for examples. Every rust code block
requires `# extern crate gungraun;` as first line if you want to access the
`gungraun` api. Also, ensure to not actually run the benchmark harness with

```rust
#...

# fn main() {
main!(library_benchmark_groups = some_group);
# }
```

## Testing

Patches have to include tests to verify (at a minimum) that the whole pipeline
runs through without errors.

The benches in the `benchmark-tests` package are system tests and run the whole
pipeline. We use a wrapper around `cargo bench` (`benchmark-tests/src/bench`) to
run the `benchmark-tests`. In order to run a single benchmark-tests use `just
full-bench-test $BENCHMARK_NAME` or all with `just full-bench-test-all` (This
might take a while). See the [`README`](./benchmark-tests/README.md) of the
benchmark-tests package for more details.

The user interface is tested in `gungraun/tests/ui`. The ui tests error
fixtures are fixed to the MSRV compiler since the compiler error messages differ
between the rust toolchains. For example to run the ui tests

```shell
just test-ui
```

or overwrite the error message fixtures:

`just test-ui-overwrite`

If you made changes in the `gungraun-runner` package, you can point the
`IAI_CALLGRIND_RUNNER` environment variable to your modified version of the
`gungraun-runner` binary and run the benchmark-tests with:

```shell
cargo build -p gungraun-runner --release
IAI_CALLGRIND_RUNNER=$(realpath target/release/gungraun-runner) cargo bench -p benchmark-tests
```

or with `just` in a single command:

```shell
just bench-test-all
```

or a specific bench of the benchmark-test package

```shell
just bench-test test_lib_bench_tools
```

The concrete results of the benchmarks are not checked when running the
benchmark tests that way. You can use

```shell
just full-bench-test test_lib_bench_tools
```

which actually verifies the stdout/stderr and/or output files of the benchmark
run according to the configuration of the benchmark (the
`$BENCHMARK_NAME.conf.yml` files in the respective benchmark folder). Depending
on the test configuration, benchmarks are sometimes run multiple times.
