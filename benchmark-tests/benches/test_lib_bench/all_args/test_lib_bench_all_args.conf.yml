# In this test all callgrind arguments as of valgrind v3.23 are used.
#
# The actual functionality of these arguments is tested only basically since
# callgrind is responsible for the functionality. However, the test verifies if
# any of these arguments cause unexpected behaviour in Iai-Callgrind itself like
# panics or errors. We also verify that all additional event kinds like Ge,
# AcLoss etc. are recorded and printed.
