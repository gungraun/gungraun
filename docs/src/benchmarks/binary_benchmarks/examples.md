# More examples needed?

As in [library benchmarks](../library_benchmarks/examples.md), I'm referring
here to the [github repository](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun).
The binary benchmarks functionality of Gungraun is tested with system tests
in the private
[benchmark-tests](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun/tree/main/benchmark-tests/benches/test_lib_bench)
package.

Each system test there can serve you as an example, but for a fully documented
and commented one see
[here](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun/blob/main/benchmark-tests/benches/test_bin_bench/intro/test_bin_bench_intro.rs).
