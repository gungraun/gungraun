# Even more Examples

I'm referring here to the [github
repository](https://github.com/iai-callgrind/iai-callgrind). We test the library
benchmarks functionality of Gungraun with system tests in the private
[benchmark-tests](https://github.com/iai-callgrind/iai-callgrind/tree/main/benchmark-tests/benches/test_lib_bench)
package.

Each system test there can serve you as an example, but for a fully documented
and commented one see
[here](https://github.com/iai-callgrind/iai-callgrind/blob/main/benchmark-tests/benches/test_lib_bench/groups/test_lib_bench_groups.rs).
