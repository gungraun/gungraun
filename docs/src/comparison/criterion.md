# Comparison of Gungraun with Criterion-rs

This is a comparison with
[Criterion-rs](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs?tab=readme-ov-file) but
some of the points in Pros and Cons also apply to other wall-clock time based
benchmarking frameworks.

Gungraun Pros:

* Gungraun can give answers that are repeatable to 7 or more significant
  digits. In comparison, actual (wall-clock) run times are scarcely repeatable
  beyond one significant digit.

  This allows to implement and measure "microoptimizations". Typical
  microoptimizations reduce the number of CPU cycles by `0.1%` or `0.05%` or
  even less. Such improvements are impossible to measure with real-world
  timings. But hundreds or thousands of microoptimizations add up, resulting in
  measurable real-world performance gains.[^note]
* Gungraun can work reliably in noisy environments especially in CI
  environments from providers like GitHub Actions or Travis-CI, where
  Criterion-rs cannot.
* The benchmark api of Gungraun is simple, intuitive and allows for a much
  more concise and clearer structure of benchmarks.
* Gungraun can benchmark functions in binary crates.
* Gungraun can benchmark private functions.
* Although Callgrind adds runtime overhead, running each benchmark exactly once
  is still usually much faster than Criterion-rs' statistical measurements.
* Criterion-rs creates plots and graphs about the averages, median etc. which
  adds considerable execution time to the execution time for each benchmark.
  Gungraun doesn't need any of these plots, since it can collect all its
  metrics in a single run.
* Gungraun generates profile output from the benchmark without further
  effort.
* With Gungraun you have native access to all the possibilities of all
  Valgrind tools, including Valgrind Client Requests.

Gungraun/Criterion-rs Mixed:

* Although it is usually not significant, due to the high precision of the
  Gungraun measurements changes in the benchmarks themselves like adding a
  benchmark case can have an effect on the other benchmarks. Gungraun can
  only try to reduce these effects to a minimum but never completely eliminate
  them. Criterion-rs does not have this problem because it cannot detect such
  small changes.

Gungraun Cons:

* Gungraun's measurements merely correlate with wall-clock time. Wall-clock
  time is an obvious choice in many cases because it corresponds to what users
  perceive and Criterion-rs measures it directly.
* Gungraun can only be used on platforms supported by Valgrind. Notably,
  this does not include Windows.
* Gungraun needs additional binaries, `valgrind` and the
  `iai-callgrind-runner`. The version of the runner needs to be in sync with the
  `iai-callgrind` library. Criterion-rs is only a library and the installation
  is usually simpler.

Especially, due to the first point in the `Cons`, I think it is still required
to run wall-clock time benchmarks and use `Criterion-rs` in conjunction with
Gungraun. But in the CI and for performance regression checks, you
shouldn't use `Criterion-rs` or other wall-clock time based benchmarks at all.
