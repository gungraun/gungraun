# Getting Help

Reach out to us on [Github
Discussions](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun/discussions) or open
an [Issue](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun/issues) in the
[Gungraun
Repository](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun). Check the
open and closed issues in the issue board, maybe you can already find a solution
to your problem there.

The api documentation can be found on
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/iai-callgrind/0.16.1/iai_callgrind/) but you might
also want to check out the `Troubleshooting` section in the sidebar of this
guide.
