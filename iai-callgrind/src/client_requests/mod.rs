//! The `iai-callgrind` rustified interface to [Valgrind's Client Request
//! Mechanism](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html#manual-core-adv.clientreq)
//!
//! You can use these methods to manipulate and query Valgrind's execution inside `iai-callgrind`
//! benchmarks or your own programs.
//!
//! Valgrind has a trapdoor mechanism via which the client program can pass all manner of requests
//! and queries to Valgrind and the current tool. The so-called client requests are provided to
//! allow you to tell Valgrind facts about the behavior of your program, and also to make queries.
//! In particular, your program can tell Valgrind about things that it otherwise would not know,
//! leading to better results.
//!
//! # Building
//!
//! The client requests need to be built with the valgrind header files. Usually, these header files
//! are installed by your distribution's package manager with the valgrind package into a global
//! include path, and you don't need to do anything but activating the `client_requests` feature
//! (see below) of the `iai-callgrind` dependency.
//!
//! If you encounter problems because the valgrind header files cannot be found, first ensure you
//! have installed valgrind and your package manager's package includes the header files. If not or
//! you use a custom build of valgrind, you can point the `IAI_CALLGRIND_VALGRIND_INCLUDE` or the
//! `IAI_CALLGRIND_<triple>_VALGRIND_INCLUDE` environment variables to the include path where the
//! valgrind headers can be found. The include directive used by `iai-callgrind` is `#include
//! "valgrind/valgrind.h"` and is prefixed with `valgrind`. For example, if the valgrind header
//! files reside in `/home/foo/repo/valgrind/{valgrind.h, callgrind.h, ...}`, then the environment
//! variable has to point to `IAI_CALLGRIND_VALGRIND_INCLUDE=/home/foo/repo` and not
//! `IAI_CALLGRIND_VALGRIND_INCLUDE=/home/foo/repo/valgrind`.
//!
//! Also, worth to consider is that the build of `iai-callgrind` with client requests takes longer
//! than the build without them.
//!
//! # Module Organization
//!
//! The client requests are organized into modules representing the source header file. So, if you
//! search for a client request originating from the `valgrind.h` header file, the client request
//! can be found in the [`crate::client_requests::valgrind`] module. Instead of using macros like in
//! valgrind we're using functions and small letter names, stripping the prefix if it is equal to
//! the enclosing module. For example the client request `RUNNING_ON_VALGRIND` from the `valgrind.h`
//! file equals [`crate::client_requests::valgrind::running_on_valgrind`] and
//! `VALGRIND_COUNT_ERRORS` from the same `valgrind.h` header file equals
//! [`crate::client_requests::valgrind::count_errors`].
//!
//! The only exception to this rule are the [`crate::valgrind_printf`] macro and its descendents
//! like [`crate::valgrind_printf_unchecked`] which can be found in the root of `iai-callgrind`.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! The client requests are organized into two separate features. The `client_requests_defs` feature
//! enables the definitions but doesn't run any code yet. To actually run the client requests you
//! need to enable the `client_requests` feature. The `client_requests` feature implies
//! `client_requests_defs`. For example, if you need to include the client requests into your
//! production code, you usually don't want them to run if not running under valgrind in the
//! `iai-callgrind` benchmarks. In order to achieve this, the `client_requests_defs` can be safely
//! included in the production code since the compiler will optimize them completely away. So, in
//! your `Cargo.toml` file, you can do
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! iai-callgrind = { version = "0.15.2", default-features = false, features = [
//!     "client_requests_defs"
//! ]}
//!
//! [dev-dependencies]
//! iai-callgrind = { version = "0.15.2", features = ["client_requests"] }
//! ```
//!
//! If you would only need the client requests in `iai-callgrind` benchmarks, you only need to add
//! `iai-callgrind` with the `client_requests` feature to your `dev-dependencies`.
//!
//! # Performance and implementation details
//!
//! Depending on the target, the client requests are optimized to run with the same overhead as
//! the original valgrind client requests in C code. The optimizations are based on inline assembly
//! with the `asm!` macro and depend on the availability of it on a specific target. Since inline
//! assembly is not stable on all targets which are supported by valgrind, we cannot provide
//! optimized client requests for them. But, you can still use the non-optimized version on all
//! platforms which would be natively supported by valgrind. In the end, all targets which are
//! covered by valgrind are also covered by `iai-callgrind`.
//!
//! The non-optimized version add overhead because we need to wrap the macro from the header file in
//! a function call. This additional function call equals the additional overhead compared to the
//! original valgrind implementation. Although this is usually not much, we try hard to avoid any
//! overhead to not slow down the benchmarks.
//!
//! Here's a short overview on which targets the optimized client requests are available and why
//! not (Valgrind version = `3.22`)
//!
//! | Target                | Optimized | Reason  |
//! | --------------------- | --------- | ------- |
//! | `x86_64/linux`        | yes | -
//! | `x86_64/freebsd`      | yes | -
//! | `x86_64/apple+darwin` | yes | -
//! | `x86_64/windows+gnu`  | yes | -
//! | `x86_64/solaris`      | yes | -
//! | `x86/linux`           | yes | -
//! | `x86/freebsd`         | yes | -
//! | `x86/apple+darwin`    | yes | -
//! | `x86/windows+gnu`     | yes | -
//! | `x86/solaris`         | yes | -
//! | `x86/windows+msvc`    | no  | TBD
//! | `arm/linux`           | yes | -
//! | `aarch64/linux`       | yes | -
//! | `x86_64/windows+msvc` | no  | unsupported by valgrind
//! | `s390x/linux`         | no  | unstable inline assembly
//! | `mips32/linux`        | no  | unstable inline assembly
//! | `mips64/linux`        | no  | unstable inline assembly
//! | `powerpc/linux`       | no  | unstable inline assembly
//! | `powerpc64/linux`     | no  | unstable inline assembly
//! | `powerpc64le/linux`   | no  | unstable inline assembly
//! | `nanomips/linux`      | no  | valgrind only
//!
//! All other targets you don't find in the table above are also not supported by valgrind, yet.
//!
//! Note this table might quickly become outdated with higher versions of valgrind, and you should
//! not rely on it to be up-to-date. As indicated above, the bindings are created dynamically in
//! such a way, that always all targets which are covered by valgrind are also covered by
//! `iai-callgrind`. They just might not have been optimized, yet. If you need to know if your
//! target is supported you should consult the `valgrind.h` header file in the [Valgrind
//! Repository](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=valgrind.git) or have a look at the [Valgrind Release
//! Notes](https://valgrind.org/downloads/current.html)
//!
//! # Sources and additional documentation
//!
//! A lot of the library documentation of the client requests within this module and its submodules
//! is taken from the online manual and the valgrind header files. For more details see also [The
//! Client Request
//! mechanism](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html#manual-core-adv.clientreq)
