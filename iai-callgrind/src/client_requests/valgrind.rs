///
/// This happens automatically for the standard allocator functions such as `malloc()`, `calloc()`,

///
/// But if your program uses a custom allocator, this doesn't automatically happen, and Valgrind
/// will not do as well. For example, if you allocate superblocks with `mmap()` and then allocates
/// chunks of the superblocks, all Valgrind's observations will be at the `mmap()` level, and it
/// won't know that the chunks should be considered separate entities.  In Memcheck's case, that
/// means you probably won't get heap block overrun detection (because there won't be redzones
/// marked as unaddressable) and you definitely won't get any leak detection.
///
/// The following client requests allow a custom allocator to be annotated so that it can be handled
/// accurately by Valgrind.
///
/// [`malloclike_block`] marks a region of memory as having been allocated by a malloc()-like
/// function. For Memcheck (an illustrative case), this does two things:
///
/// - It records that the block has been allocated.  This means any addresses within the block
///   mentioned in error messages will be identified as belonging to the block.  It also means that
///   if the block isn't freed it will be detected by the leak checker.
/// - It marks the block as being addressable and undefined (if `is_zeroed` is not set), or
///   addressable and defined (if `is_zeroed` is set). This controls how accesses to the block by
///   the program are handled.
///
/// `addr` is the start of the usable block (ie. after any redzone), `size` is its size. `redzone`
/// is the redzone size if the allocator can apply redzones -- these are blocks of padding at the
/// start and end of each block. Adding redzones is recommended as it makes it much more likely
/// Valgrind will spot block overruns. `is_zeroed` indicates if the memory is zeroed (or filled
/// with another predictable value), as is the case for `calloc()`.
///
/// [`malloclike_block`] should be put immediately after the point where a heap block -- that will
/// be used by the client program -- is allocated. It's best to put it at the outermost level of the
/// allocator if possible; for example, if you have a function `my_alloc()` which calls
/// `internal_alloc()`, and the client request is put inside `internal_alloc()`, stack traces
/// relating to the heap block will contain entries for both `my_alloc()` and `internal_alloc()`,
/// which is probably not what you want.
///
/// For Memcheck users: if you use [`malloclike_block`] to carve out custom blocks from within a
/// heap block, B, that has been allocated with malloc/calloc/new/etc, then block B will be
/// *ignored* during leak-checking -- the custom blocks will take precedence.
///
/// In many cases, these three client requests (`malloclike_block`, [`resizeinplace_block`],
/// [`freelike_block`]) will not be enough to get your allocator working well with Memcheck. More
/// specifically, if your allocator writes to freed blocks in any way then a
/// [`super::memcheck::make_mem_undefined`] call will be necessary to mark the memory as addressable
/// just before the zeroing occurs, otherwise you'll get a lot of invalid write errors.  For
/// example, you'll need to do this if your allocator recycles freed blocks, but it zeroes them
/// before handing them back out (via `malloclike_block`). Alternatively, if your allocator reuses
/// freed blocks for allocator-internal data structures, [`super::memcheck::make_mem_undefined`]
/// calls will also be necessary.
///
/// Really, what's happening is a blurring of the lines between the client program and the
/// allocator... after [`freelike_block`] is called, the memory should be considered unaddressable
/// to the client program, but the allocator knows more than the rest of the client program and so
/// may be able to safely access it. Extra client requests are necessary for Valgrind to understand
/// the distinction between the allocator and the rest of the program.
